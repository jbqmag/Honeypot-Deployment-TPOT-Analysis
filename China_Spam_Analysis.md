### Summary:
- **IP Address**: 43.139.208.95
- **Risk Level**: High
- **Identified as**: Potential Spammer, Malicious Entity
- **Associated Activities**: Spamming, Potential Involvement in Malicious Campaigns, DNS Exploitation
- **ASN Associated**: Shenzhen Tencent Computer Systems Company Limited
- **Port(s) Attacked**: 53 (DNS)

This IP address, originating from China, has been flagged as a high-risk entity due to its involvement in spamming activities and being listed on multiple blocklists along with other malcious machines. Reconnaisance of this IP was discovered through the use of the Honeytrap dashboard of TPOT, suggesting that the attacker fell for the configuration of a DNS service.<sub> [1](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Attacks%20by%20port.png)</sub> This IP was notable due to its ties with China and- although much lower frequency than other attackers- had a significant amount of attacks (6000+) only after 3 days of data collection. With a significant number of interactions focused on DNS (port 53), reputation analysis on Cisco Talos further confirms that this IP has a poor sender reputation and is likely involved in spam-related activities. <sub>[5](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Bad%20IP%20Reputation%20Cisco%20Scanner.png)<sub/>

### Findings:
#### 1. Potential Spammer
   - **Description**: The IP address has been identified as a potential spammer by multiple sources, including Spamhaus (Zen). This indicates that the IP is involved in sending unsolicited emails or other spam-related activities. <sub> [2](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Spiderfoot%20Scan%20Correlation%20Results.png)</sub>
   - **Source Module**: `sfp_spamhaus`
   - **Date Identified**: 2024-08-17
   - **Risk**: High - Spamming activities can be indicative of a broader malicious campaign, including phishing attempts or malware distribution.

#### 2. UCEPROTECT Listing 
   - **Description**: The IP address has also been listed on UCEPROTECT Level 2, which highlights IP addresses involved in abusive activities. While UCEPROTECT may sometimes include false positives, the presence of this IP on their list suggests it is involved in or associated with malicious activities.<sub> [2](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Spiderfoot%20Scan%20Correlation%20Results.png)</sub> 
   - **Source Module**: `sfp_uceprotect`
   - **Date Identified**: 2024-08-17
   - **Risk**: Moderate - While UCEPROTECT Level 2 listings can include false positives, the association with spam-related activities raises the overall risk level.

#### 3. Affiliated Malicious Entities
   - **Description**: This IP is part of a broader network of IP addresses (e.g., 43.139.208.x) that are flagged as malicious by multiple sources. This indicates that the IP is likely part of a coordinated effort or campaign involving other malicious entities.<sub> [3](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Affiliated%20Blacklisted%20Graph.png)</sub>
   - **Source Module**: Various
   - **Date Identified**: 2024-08-17
   - **Risk**: Moderate to High - The association with other flagged IPs increases the likelihood that this IP is involved in a larger malicious operation.

### Correlation with Honeypot Data:
- **Honeypot Activity**: The IP address 43.139.208.95, originating from China, was one of the more notable attackers, albeit having a lower frequency of attacks compared to other countries. The IP primarily targeted DNS (port 53), indicating an interest in exploiting DNS services for malicious purposes. The sheer volume (6,000+ attacks) of activity suggests that this IP is part of a broader effort to exploit DNS services, possibly as part of a spam or malware distribution campaign.

### Observations:
1. **Spamming as a Malicious Tactic**: The identification of this IP as a spammer suggests that the attacker may be using DNS to support their spam activities. DNS plays a crucial role in resolving domain names used in spam campaigns, including phishing sites and command-and-control servers for malware distribution.
2. **DNS Exploitation**: The focus on DNS (port 53) implies that the attacker may be attempting to exploit DNS services for purposes such as DNS tunneling, DNS amplification attacks, or redirecting traffic to malicious domains. By compromising or manipulating DNS, the attacker could enhance their spam operations by making their infrastructure harder to detect or block.<sub> [1](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Attacks%20by%20port.png)</sub>

3. **Affiliation with Malicious Network**: The association with other flagged IP addresses in the 43.139.208.x range indicates that this IP is likely part of a coordinated attack infrastructure, potentially linked to a botnet or other malicious network.<sub> [2](https://github.com/jbqmag/Honeypot-Honeytrap-Analysis/blob/main/Spiderfoot%20Scan%20Correlation%20Results.png)</sub>   The use of DNS in such operations is common, as DNS can provide a resilient and flexible communication method for attackers.

### Hypothetical Hardening Considerations:
1. **Block IP Address**: Given the noticeable volume of attacks and the malicious reputation of this IP, it is recommended to employ a firewall and necessary configurations to firewall rules to further prevent such attempts at spam. Given that this is a honeypot, we should be fine to keep the service running to collect more information on the attacker network.
2. **Monitor for Similar IPs**: Given the broader network of affiliated malicious entities, it is advisable to monitor for similar IP addresses (e.g., within the 43.139.208.x range) and take appropriate action as they are detected in order to better understand our attacker's motive or pattern.
3. **Strengthen DNS Security**: Given the focus on DNS, consider implementing DNS security measures such as DNSSEC (Domain Name System Security Extensions) to prevent DNS hijacking or cache poisoning. Additionally, ensure that the DNS infrastructure is configured securely and is not vulnerable to amplification attacks.

### Future Considerations:
- **Investigate Further**: Further investigation into the broader network of IP addresses associated with this entity could provide more insights into the scope and nature of the attack campaign. Specifically, look for connections between DNS queries and known malicious domains.
- **Strengthen Spam Defenses**: Consider strengthening spam defenses, both at the network and email levels, to mitigate the risk of future spam-related attacks. Ensure that your DNS servers are not being exploited for spam distribution.
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Maintain continuous monitoring for any new activity from this IP address or related entities to ensure prompt detection and response. Pay special attention to DNS traffic, as this may reveal further attempts to exploit DNS services.

### Conclusion:
The consistent targeting of DNS (port 53) by IP address 43.139.208.95, combined with its reputation as a spammer, suggests that the attacker may be attempting to exploit DNS services to support spam and phishing campaigns. By manipulating DNS, the attacker could enhance the effectiveness of their malicious operations, making it harder for defenders to detect and block their activities. The association with a broader network of malicious IP addresses further supports the conclusion that this IP is part of a coordinated attack infrastructure. Deeper investigation into the physical locations, affiliated emails, and the attacker subnetwork may be of use to further understand and fend off against future DNS spam attackers.
